(1) In some cases, we use external service providers to process your data. These have been
carefully selected and commissioned by us, are bound by our instructions and
are checked regularly.

(2) Use of social media plug-ins

(2a) We currently use the following social media plug-ins: LinkedIn and Twitter. We use the
so-called two-click solution. This means that when you visit our site, no
personal data is initially passed on to the plug-in providers. You can
recognize the provider of the plug-in by the marking on the box above its
initial letter or the logo. We give you the opportunity to use the button to
communicate directly with the provider of the plug-in. Only if you click on the
marked field and thereby activate it will the plug-in provider receive the
information that you have accessed the corresponding website of our online
offer. In addition, the data mentioned under Section 3 of this declaration will
be transmitted. By activating the plug-in, your personal data will be
transmitted to the respective plug-in provider and stored there (in the case of
US providers in the USA). Since the plug-in provider collects data in particular
via cookies, we recommend that you delete all cookies using the security
settings of your browser before clicking on the grayed-out box.

(2b) We have no influence on the data collected and the data processing operations, nor are we
aware of the full scope of data collection, the purposes of processing or the
storage periods. We also have no information on the deletion of the data
collected by the plug-in provider.

(2c) The plug-in provider saves the data collected about you as a user profile and uses this for
advertising, market research and / or needs-based design of its website. Such
an evaluation takes place in particular (even for users who are not logged in)
to display needs-based advertising and to inform other users of the social
network about your activities on our website. You have the right to object to
the creation of these user profiles, although you must contact the respective
plug-in provider to exercise this right. Via the plug-ins, we offer you the
opportunity to interact with social networks and other users, so that we can
improve our offer and make it more interesting for you as a user. The legal
basis for using the plug-ins is Art. 6 Para. 1 S. 1 lit. f GDPR.

(2d) The data is passed on regardless of whether you have an account with the plug-in provider
and are logged in there. If you are logged in with the plug-in provider, your
data collected by us will be assigned directly to your existing account with
the plug-in provider. If you press the activated button and z. For example, if
you link the page, the plug-in provider will also save this information in your
user account and share it publicly with your contacts. We recommend that you
log out regularly after using a social network, but especially before
activating the button, as this allows you to avoid being assigned to your
profile with the plug-in provider.

(2e) Further information on the purpose and scope of the data collection and its processing
by the plug-in provider can be found in the data protection declarations of
these providers as notified below. There you will also find further information
on your rights in this regard and setting options to protect your privacy.
