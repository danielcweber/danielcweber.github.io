My name is Daniel Weber. I am a Senior Software Engineer with [ExRam Innovations](https://www.exram.de/) in Germany. Before settling for C# as my language of choice, and .NET as my preferred platform to develop for in 2002, I would play around with Visual Basic, QBasic and even Amiga Basic.

I got my Master's degree in Computer Science in 2011 from [RWTH Aachen University](https://www.rwth-aachen.de/) with specialization in [Software Modeling and Verification](https://moves.rwth-aachen.de/) and a minor subject of [Electrical Engineering](http://www.ient.rwth-aachen.de/).

As part of my current job, I created [ExRam.Gremlinq](https://github.com/ExRam/ExRam.Gremlinq), a .NET object-graph-mapper for [Apache TinkerPop](https://tinkerpop.apache.org/) Gremlin enabled databases like [Azure Cosmos DB](https://azure.microsoft.com/de-de/services/cosmos-db/), [JanusGraph](https://janusgraph.org/) or [AWS Neptune](https://aws.amazon.com/de/neptune/). ExRam.Gremlinq strives to become for the world of graph-databases what e.g. Entity Framework or NHibernate are for traditional SQL-databases.
