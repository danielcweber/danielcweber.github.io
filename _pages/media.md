In 2021, I was allowed to write my first article about Gremlinq in the German <i>dotnetpro</i> magazine issue 02/21: [Gremlin + Linq = Gremlinq](https://www.dotnetpro.de/tools/datenzugriff/gremlin-plus-linq-gremlinq-2621192.html).

This was followed up by an article that explored handling data in C# using both, the time and space dimensions (issue 05/21): [C# in Raum und Zeit](https://www.dotnetpro.de/planung/c/c-in-raum-zeit-2653216.html).

I was invited by [Jamie Taylor](https://about.me/thejamietaylor) to talk about Gremlinq on an [episode of his .NET Core Podcast](https://dotnetcore.show/episode-81-gremlinq-with-daniel-weber/).

[Mark Brown](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/cosmosdb/author/mjbrown/) had me on [an episode of CosmosDB Live TV](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W32CZyfWWjY).
